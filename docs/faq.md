# Polonium FAQ

### How do I create a log for my issue?

Follow the instructions [here](usage.md#getting-a-log).

### Fullscreen isn't working correctly

Some apps do not handle fullscreen correctly.

### This works on Wayland but not X11

X11 is not officially supported, but you can drop an issue and I can see if I can fix it. Include a log!
